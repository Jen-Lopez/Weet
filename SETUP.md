## Getting Started

Use the following instructions to get the application up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

``` git clone https://github.com/SiddharthDatar/Weet.git```

### 2. Open the Project with a Java-supported IDE/Editor (e.g. IntelliJ, VScode)

### 3. Set the OpenMenu API key as an Environment Variable

In order to call the OpenMenu API endpoints, we need to provide our api key. For security reasons, the api key is excluded from our code. However, it can be accessed by our program via environment variables.

In your terminal, run the following command (replacing `{INSERT_KEY_HERE}` with the actual key value):

``` export API_KEY={INSERT_KEY_HERE}```
